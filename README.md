# Website Design System

In this project, I have built a simple legend for a **fictional website's style**. It is built for practical learning purposes from _Codecademy_'s "Build a Website Design System" exercise proposal. Fonts by _Google Fonts_.

If you stumble across this repo, I would really appreciate if you could do a quick code review to let me know about any improvements! Thanks a lot!!
